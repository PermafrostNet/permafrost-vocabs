http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0005,active-layer failure,,A general term referring to several forms of slope failures or failure mechanisms commonly occurring in the active layer overlying permafrost (see Figure 21a).,These include detachment failures but not retrogressive thaw slumps and thaw slumping since these involve permafrost.,skin flow,,,t0005,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386565
http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0006,active-layer thickness,,The thickness of the layer of the ground that is subject to annual thawing and freeing in areas underlain by permafrost.,"The thickness of the active layer depends on such factors as the ambient air temperature, vegetation, drainage, soil or rock type and total water content, snowcover, and degree and orientation of slope. As a rule, the active layer is thin in the High Arctic (it can be less than 15 cm) and becomes thicker farther south (1 m or more). The thickness of the active layer can vary from year to year, primarily due to variations in the mean annual air temperature, distribution of soil moisture, and snowcover. The thickness of the active layer includes the uppermost part of the permafrost wherever either the salinity or clay content of the permafrost allows it to thaw and refreeze annually, even though the material remains cryotic (T < 0�C). Use of the term ""depth to permafrost"" as a synonym for the thickness of the active layer is misleading, especially in areas where the active layer is separated from the permafrost by a residual thaw layer, that is, by a thawed or noncryotic (T> 0�C) layer of ground.",,,,t0006,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386566

http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0015,alas/alass,,A large depression of the ground surface produced by thawing of a large area of very thick and exceedingly ice-rich permafrost.,"Typically, alasses are large depressions ranging from 0.5 to more than 100 km2 in area and from 5 to 20 m in depth. In the early stages of formation, a shallow (? 2 m) circular ""alas lake"" forms in a steep-sided depression. Enlargement and ultimate drainage of a number of such lakes may leave low interalas plateaus (termed ""mezhalasye"" in Russian). Ultimately, the plateaus disappear and mass wasting produces gentle side slopes. The term is of Yakut origin. The term is of Yakut origin. An analogous term of Nenets (northwestern Siberia) origin is ""khasyrey"".",,,,t0015,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386575

A noteable exception is found in the southwestern portion of Yukon, where (1) the high St. Elias Mountains block the circulation of moist and warm maritime air from the Pacific Ocean, particularly in winter, and (2) the deeply dissected nature of the terrain promotes cold-air drainage and ponding in the valleys. As a result, permafrost is more extensive, thicker and colder in valley bottoms than at higher elevations.",,,,t0018,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386578

http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0032,BTS method,,"Method to predict the presence or absence of permafrost in a mountain area, using measurements of the bottom temperature of snow cover in mid- to late-winter.","Snow cover, with its low thermal conductivity, insulates the soil from short- term fluctuations in air temperature. In those mountain areas where snow-cover thickness equals or exceeds 1 m and surface melting is still negligible in mid- to late-winter, BTS values remain virtually constant, mainly controlled by heat transfer from the upper ground layers, which in turn is strongly influenced by the presence or absence of permafrost.

Repeated injections of expelled water into the overlying permafrost, followed by freezing of the injected water, cause progressive doming, and produce the massive ice forming the core of the pingo. Progressive formation of segregated ice and dilation crack ice can also contribute to the process.",hydrostatic pingo, Mackenzie Delta pingo,,t0037,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386597

http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0039,coefficient of compressibility,,"The volume change per unit volume of a substance per unit increase in effective compressive stress, under isothermal conditions.","Frozen soils are usually considered to be practically incompressible, and volume-change deformations can therefore be neglected. Numerous investigations have shown, however, that the compressibility of frozen soils can be significant and should not be neglected in some cases, especially when large areas are to be loaded. Compressibility and its time dependence in frozen soils are due to several causes, such as instantaneous compression of the gaseous phase, creep of the pore ice due to shear stresses at the grain contacts, and hydrodynamic consolidation due to the expulsion of unfrozen water under stress, the amount of which varies with the applied pressure.",,,,t0039,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386599

Irregular topography (hence thermokarst terrain) may be present on the peatland as a whole but the collapse scars are only part of that thermokarst terrain, marked by the absence of permafrost, and by vegetation different from that on both the previously unfrozen peatlands and the remnant permafrost peat landforms.",,,,t0040,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386600
http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0041,composite wedge,fente en coin � remplissage compos� ,A wedge showing evidence of both primary and secondary filling.,"When used with reference to thermal contraction crack phenomena in permafrost, it describes a wedge filled by a combination of ice and soil (usually sand). The term is also frequently used to describe Pleistocene sand wedges and ice-wedge casts. Typically, composite wedges are filled with material very similar in structure and texture to sands in a typical fissure of primary filling (i.e., sand wedge). However, there may be inclusions of material from the fissure walls and some distortion of the adjacent sediments bordering the wedge, reflecting the presence of ice in the original fill material.",,,,t0041,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386601

http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0043,construction methods in permafrost,,Special design and construction procedures required when engineering works are undertaken in permafrost areas. ,"Design and construction of engineering works on permafrost normally follow one of two broad principles which are based on whether or not the frozen foundation soil or rock is thaw-stable (thaw-stable permafrost) or thaw-unstable (thaw-sensitive permafrost). Permafrost conditions can be neglected, and conventional designs and construction methods used when foundation materials are stable upon thawing. When the foundation materials are thaw-sensitive, however, then either the ""passive"" or ""active"" design and construction method is selected. The passive method maintains the foundation materials in a frozen state. Preservation of the frozen condition or permafrost aggradation can be accomplished using thermal piles or thermosyphons, or by using either a ventilation or an insulation construction technique; often a combination of these techniques is used. The ventilation technique requires that there is a clear space left between the bottom of the structure and the ground surface, or that the structure is placed on a fill pad with ducts incorporated in the pad or the floor system. Movement of cold air through the air space or ducts dissipates heat from the structure above and removes heat from the ground below. Using the insulation technique, a relatively thick fill (sometimes containing a layer of insulation) is placed on the ground surface to prevent thawing or to reduce or control the depth of thaw below the original ground surface. When permafrost degradation cannot be prevented, then one of the active methods must be considered. Two main approaches are possible. Unfavourable foundation materials are thawed and compacted or replaced with more suitable materials before the structure is erected. Alternatively, the foundations and structure are designed to accommodate the thaw settlements that will occur.",,,,t0043,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386603

In ice-saturated frozen soils, most creep deformations are distortional with little or no volume change. In frozen soils with large unfrozen water contents or in unsaturated frozen soils, slow deformations due to consolidation, and creep due to volume change, may also occur. Usually, a large portion of the creep deformation is permanent.",,,,t0046,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386606

The lenses are formed normal to the direction of heat flow and when freezing penetrates from the ground surface (which may be horizontal, sloping or vertical), they form parallel to that surface.

Epigenetic ice wedges are characteristically wedge-shaped, whereas syngenetic ice wedges and anti-syngenetic ice wedges are generally wedge-shaped but with more irregular sides (see also epigenetic permafrost, syngenetic permafrost). Ice wedges are formed in thermal contraction cracks in which hoar frost (see open-cavity ice) forms and into which water from melting snow penetrates in the spring. Repeated annual contraction cracking of the ice in the wedge, followed by freezing of water in the crack, gradually increases the width (and possibly the depth) of the wedge and causes vertical banding of the ice mass. The surface expression of ice wedges is generally a network of polygons. Ice wedges growing as a result of repeated (but not necessarily annual) winter cracking are called active ice wedges.

http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0205,mechanical properties of frozen ground,propri�t�s m�caniques du g�lisol ,The properties of frozen ground governing its deformability and strength.,"1. Properties under quasi-static loading: The behaviour of frozen soils under quasi-static loading is usually different from that of unfrozen soils because of the presence of ice and unfrozen water films. In particular, frozen soils are more susceptible to creep and relaxation effects, and their behaviour is strongly affected by temperature change. In addition to creep, volumetric consolidation may also develop in frozen soils with large unfrozen water contents. As with unfrozen soils, the strength of frozen soils depends on interparticle friction, particle interlocking and cohesion. In frozen soil, however, bonding of particles by ice is the dominant strength factor. This is complicated by the unfrozen water films surrounding the soil particles, which reduce interparticle bonding. The strength of ice in frozen soil is dependent on many factors, such as temperature, pressure, strain rate, grain size, crystal orientation and density. At very high ice contents, frozen soil behaviour under load is similar to that of ice. At low ice contents, however, when interparticle forces begin to contribute, the unfrozen water films play an important role, especially in fine-grained frozen soils. (a) Deformability and strength: The deformability and strength of a frozen soil can be studied by specially designed tests either in a cold room or in situ. Quasi-static elastic parameters usually determined in such tests are: Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for short- term response, and creep parameters (used in a creep equation) for long-term response. In addition, the variation of strength with time or with strain rate is also determined from the tests. The strength is usually found to vary from a high short- term value to a much smaller long-term value, which is considered to govern the behaviour of frozen soil under sustained loading. Under high confining stresses and at relatively high freezing temperatures, most frozen soils creep and eventually fail in a plastic manner. On the other hand, under compression at low confining stresses, or at tensile stresses combined with low temperatures, many frozen soils fail in a brittle manner by tensile crack propagation. (b) Compressibility of frozen soils: Although frozen soils are usually considered to be practically incompressible, and volume change deformations can therefore be neglected, investigations show, however, that the compressibility of frozen soils can be significant and should not be neglected in some cases, especially when large areas are loaded. Compressibility and its time dependence in frozen soils are due to several causes, such as instantaneous compression of the gaseous phase, creep of the pore ice due to shear stresses at the grain contacts, and hydrodynamic consolidation due to the expulsion of unfrozen water under stress, the amount of which varies with the applied pressure. 2. Dynamic properties of frozen ground: Information on the dynamic properties of frozen soils is important with regard to the behaviour of structures subjected to seismic or vibratory loads, and the evaluation of results of seismic field surveys in permafrost areas. Dynamic properties are expressed either in terms of two dynamic elastic parameters: the dynamic modulus of elasticity and the dynamic Poisson's ratio, or in terms of the propagation velocities of compressional waves and shear waves in the material. The two sets of dynamic parameters are uniquely related by the theory of elasticity. The dynamic elastic parameters deduced from wave propagation velocities are different from those obtained from any type of static loading tests because the latter contain the additional effects of elastic relaxation and creep. Parameters that influence the compressional and shear wave velocities in soils and rocks include grain size, lithology, total water content, porosity and pore structure, the nature, temperature and degree of freezing of the interstitial water, degree of cementation, and confining pressure. Due to the ice content, seismic velocities are generally higher in frozen soils or rocks than in the same unfrozen materials. The change in velocity can occur gradually as temperatures decrease below 0�C, if freezing point depression conditions exist in the soil.",,,,t0205,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386765

Fosgren (1966) and �hman (1977) also reported ""palsas"" developed entirely in mineral soil, and they called both types ""minerogenic palsas"". Harris (1993) described a sequence of stages in the development of palsa-like mounds developed entirely in mineral soils in the Fox Lake area (Yukon), for which he proposed the name ""lithalsa"".

Because air temperatures (measured at weather stations) are usually available and surface temperatures are not, the n- factor (an empirically determined coefficient) is used to relate air temperatures to surface temperatures in order to establish the thermal boundary condition at the surface, particularly for engineering purposes. The difference between air and surface temperatures at any specific time and location is greatly influenced by climatic, surface and subsurface conditions (e.g., latitude, cloud cover, time of day or year, relative humidity, wind speed, type of surface--wet, dry, moss, snow, natural vegetated terrain, mineral soil, pavements-- and thermal properties of the ground). The average surface temperature and n- factor may vary significantly from year to year, even for a given surface and location, as well as for different sites, surfaces and soil systems. Values of the freezing and thawing n-factors have been determined for a large number of sites and surfaces and are widely used for predicting surface temperatures and the thermal regime of the ground. The data vary widely, however, and indicate that a rigorous value of n for a given site cannot simply be chosen from these data. Direct determination of the n-factor for a specific location is much better and requires concurrent observations of air and surface temperatures throughout at least one and preferably several complete freezing and thawing seasons.",,,,t0212,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386772

The term is of Fennoscandian origin, originally meaning "". a hummock rising out of a bog with a core of ice"" (Sepp�l�, 1972). Implicit in this definition are their constructional nature, their origin in wetlands (fens or peat bogs), and that ice segregation in mineral soil beneath peat is the process responsible for growth. Most, but not all, palsas occur in the discontinuous permafrost zone. A more general definition has been proposed by Washburn (1983) in which the term is applied in a descriptive sense to a broader range of permafrost mounds that may include intrusive as well as segregated ice: ""Palsas are peaty permafrost mounds, ranging from about 0.5 to about 10 m in height and exceeding about 2 m in average diameter, comprising (1) aggradation forms due to permafrost aggradation at an active-layer/permafrost contact zone, and (2) similar-appearing degradation forms due to disintegration of an extensive peaty deposit"". The disadvantage of this broader definition is that mounds of entirely different origins (e.g., those including intrusive ice) are grouped under one term. It is proposed, therefore, that the term ""palsa"" be restricted to those features where the internal structure shows the presence of segregated ice and where the environment lacks high hydraulic potentials, provided that other parameters (size, shape, location in wetlands) are also satisfied.

Preservation of the frozen condition or permafrost aggradation can be accomplished using thermal piles or thermosyphons, or by using either a ventilation or an insulation construction technique; often a combination of these techniques is used. The ventilation technique requires that there is a clear space left between the bottom of the structure and the ground surface, or that the structure is placed on a fill pad with ventilation ducts incorporated in the pad or the floor system.Movement of cold air through the air space or ducts dissipates heat from the structure above and removes heat from the ground below.

In general, on thawing, any frozen ground will settle both under its own weight and under applied stresses. The settlement will continue as long as the thawing front advances and until the pore pressures generated during thawing are dissipated. In relatively permeable coarse-grained soils, where draining of pore water is rapid, the thaw settlement rate will usually follow closely the rate of thaw, and development of pore pressures will be negligible during the thaw period. On the other hand, if a relatively impermeable fine-grained soil is thawed rapidly, then excess pore pressures will be generated.

The basic thermal properties of frozen ground are thermal conductivity, heat capacity and latent heat of fusion. Thermal conductivity is a measure of the quantity of heat that will flow through a unit area of a substance in unit time under a unit temperature gradient. Heat capacity (specific heat) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree (sensible heat capacity). Volumetric heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit volume of a substance by one degree. It is equal to the heat capacity multiplied by the density. Because the phase change in frozen soils is often gradual and continuous, the term ""apparent heat capacity"" is introduced to designate the rate of change of the total heat content (sensible plus latent heat) with temperature. The volumetric latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat required to melt the ice (or freeze the water) in a unit volume of soil. When phase change occurs over a temperature range, the latent heat manifests itself as an apparent (large) increase in heat capacity. Thermal diffusivity is defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity to the volumetric heat capacity. It expresses the facility with which a material will undergo temperature change. These thermal properties vary with phase composition and hence temperature, soil type, total water content, porosity, degree of saturation, density and organic content.",,,,t0363,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386923
http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0364,thermal regime of the ground,,A general term encompassing the temperature distribution and heat flows in the ground and their time-dependence (see Figure 2).,"Permafrost exists as a result of thermal conditions that maintain a ground temperature that does not rise above 0�C for at least two years. The ground temperature distribution is complicated, varying with depth from the surface and with time. Ground temperatures fluctuate in cyclical patterns on a daily and a yearly basis, in response to the heat losses and gains at the ground surface. The heat balance at the ground surface (which is indicated by the surface temperature) is highly variable with time, being affected by terrain and climate conditions as well by as the thermal properties of the ground itself. Changes in surface temperature impose a response that decays while travelling downwards. The rate of decay depends on the time scale involved, on the soil thermal properties and on the occurrence of freezing and thawing phenomena. The depth beyond which ground temperature fluctuations can be considered insignificant is the depth of zero annual amplitude. The effects of daily temperature variations at the ground surface penetrate to only a few centimetres; those due to weekly variations (e.g., transient weather systems) penetrate to perhaps several metres; and annual variations penetrate to a depth of about 10 to 20 metres. Longer-term changes in surface temperature caused by changes in climate and surface conditions may modify the thermal regime of the ground to much greater depths. Permafrost exists if the mean annual surface temperature is perennially below 0�C. Although the mean annual surface temperature may be below 0�C, the surface temperature will fluctuate during the year, causing a layer of ground immediately beneath the surface to thaw in the summer and freeze in the winter (the active layer). Small changes in the annual range of surface temperature and in the mean annual surface temperature from year to year, or over a period of a few years, may cause a layer of ground between the bottom of the active layer and the permafrost table to remain at a temperature above 0�C, creating a talik or residual thaw layer. The mean annual ground temperature usually increases with depth below the surface. In some northern areas, however, it is not uncommon to find that the mean annual ground temperature decreases in the upper 50 to 100 metres below the ground surface as a result of past changes in surface and climate conditions. Below that depth, it will increase as a result of heat flow from the interior of the earth. The rate of change of temperature with depth in the earth is known as the geothermal gradient. The geothermal gradient at a specific location can be determined from accurate measurements of ground temperature made at several depths to obtain the temperature profile over a period of time. A rough approximation of the mean annual surface temperature can be made by extrapolating the geothermal gradient to the ground surface. In permafrost areas, extrapolation of the gradient downwards to the point where the ground temperature changes from below to above 0�C will provide an estimate of the depth to the permafrost base. The thermal regime of the ground at various locations is often assessed using the mean annual ground temperature at the depth of zero annual amplitude. The geothermal heat flux is the amount of heat moving steadily outward from the interior of the earth by conduction through a unit area in unit time. It is generally calculated as the product of the geothermal gradient and the thermal conductivity of the earth materials at a given depth; its value is very small.",,,,t0364,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386924

The melting of ground ice may be initiated by climatic change, destruction of an insulating vegetation cover by fire, animals or man, or by any other disturbance of the thermal regime of the ground, including the acceleration of the rate of thawing by moving water. Annual thawing of the active layer does not produce thermokarst terrain. Morphological features of thermokarst topography include depressions (see alas); lakes (see oriented lake; thermokarst lake); mounds (see thermokarst mound); and small, more or less equidimensional depressions or pits. Thermokarst landforms may be divided into active and inactive forms. Inactive thermokarst indicates that thermal equilibrium has been regained, whereas active thermokarst indicates continuing thermal disequilibrium. Except for thaw sinks there may be little underground drainage in thermokarst terrain.",,,,t0371,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386931
http://w3id.org/permafrost/v/nrcglossary/t0372,thermosyphon,thermosiphon ,A passive heat transfer device installed to remove heat from the ground (see Figure 24).,"A thermosyphon, also called thermotube, or heat pipe, usually consists of a sealed tube, with a small radiator above the ground surface, containing a liquid and/or gas. These devices have no moving parts, require no external power for operation, and function only when air temperatures are lower than the ground temperature. They may be either single- or two-phase systems. A single-phase thermosyphon is usually liquid- or air-filled. During the winter, heat from the soil surrounding the embedded portion of the pipe is absorbed by and thus warms the working fluid, which rises to the above-ground radiator section of the pipe exposed to the cooler air and loses its heat by conduction and natural convection. A two-phase thermosyphon contains a working fluid that can be in either the liquid or vapour phase, depending on its temperature. When the air temperature falls below the ground temperature, the vapour condenses in the radiator section of the tube, the pressure in the tube is reduced and the liquid in the lower section starts to boil.  The resulting cycle of boiling, vapour movement up the tube, condensation, and return of the condensate by gravity flow is an effective way of transferring heat up the tube, thus cooling the ground.",,,,t0372,,,,https://doi.org/10.4224/20386932

The total water content of a soil or rock sample includes free water, interfacial (adsorbed) water, and water absorbed by organic material. Water of crystallization or hydration (e.g., in gypsum) is usually not included. The total water content is normally determined in one of two ways: 1. on a dry-weight basis (gravimetric total water content), as the ratio of the mass of the water and ice in a sample to the dry mass of the sample, expressed as a percentage; or 2. on a volume basis (volumetric total water content), as the ratio of the volume of water and ice in a sample to the volume of the whole sample, expressed as a fraction (or, less commonly, as a percentage). Because of the way in which it is defined, the volumetric total water content cannot exceed unity, whereas the gravimetric total water content can greatly exceed 100 percent.
